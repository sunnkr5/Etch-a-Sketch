# 16x16 Grid Sketch Pad

This project creates a 16x16 grid of square divs that allow you to interact with them by hovering your mouse over them. The grid is created dynamically using JavaScript, and Flexbox is used to display the squares as a grid. The goal of this project is to practice Flexbox and JavaScript DOM manipulation.

## Features

- **Dynamic Grid Generation**: A grid of square divs is created dynamically using JavaScript (not hard-coded in HTML).
- **Flexbox Layout**: Flexbox is used to position the squares into a grid layout.
- **Hover Effect**: When you hover over any square, it changes color, leaving a trail as your mouse moves across the grid.
- **Interactive Grid Size**: A button at the top of the page allows the user to set the number of squares per side for the grid. When clicked, the existing grid is removed, and a new grid is generated in the same total space.
- **Progressive Darkening Effect**: Each square darkens progressively when hovered, and the square can become fully black after 10 interactions.
- **Random Color Effect (Extra Credit)**: Each square changes to a random RGB color each time it is hovered over.
